title: ECG Classification with Dual Models: XGBoost Voting and Deep Learning with Attention

This is a summary of the work from November 2022 to April 2023, and the final results were published on the 16th ICACTE.
The main work is to use GAN to perform data enhancement on the dual-channel ECG data of the MIT-BIH data set, and to use the lightweight model XGVoting and the deep network CRANet for ECG classification.
